# Quickstart

## Setup the server

### 1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket and service account.   

```bash 
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$BUCKET_NAME --project=PROJECT_ID --location=$BUCKET_LOCATION --uniform-bucket-level-access
```
!!! node "`$BUCKET_NAME` needs to be a unique name"

Create a Service Account for the Petra server with the `Storage Object Admin` role on the `$BUCKET_NAME` bucket and `Service Account Token Creator` on the project if you want the server to run with the `SIGNED_URL` option.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SA_NAME

# If you are not using the SIGNED_URL option, you will need to give each serviceAccount/user using the terraform modules read rights on the bucket. 
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$BUCKET_NAME \
    --member=serviceAccount:$SA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/storage.objectAdmin

# (optional) If you want to run Petra server in the SIGNED_URL mode.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```
!!! note "To push modules to the `$BUCKET_NAME` bucket, the serviceAccount/user running petractl will need write access to the bucket."

### 2. Build & Deploy to Cloud Run

From `ghcr.io` images cannot be used in Cloud Run, you will have to host the docker image on either [Google's Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images) or {--Container Registry--} `(deprecated)`, or DockerHub. 
With Artifact Registry, your `$IMAGE_PATH` will looks like `[$REGION-]docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$REGISTRY_NAME/petra:$TAG`

=== "Rebuild and push with Cloud Build"

    ```yaml title="cloudbuild.yaml"
    steps:
    # Build the container image
    - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['build', '-t', '$IMAGE_PATH', '-f',  'Dockerfile.manual', '.']
    # Push the container image to Container Registry
    - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args: ['push', '$IMAGE_PATH']
    # Deploy container image to Cloud Run
    - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    entrypoint: gcloud
    args: ['run', 'deploy', 'petra', '--image', '$IMAGE_PATH', '--platform', 'managed', '--region', '$REGION', '--allow-unauthenticated' '--set-env-vars', 'GCS_BUCKET=$BUCKET']
    images:
    -  $IMAGE_PATH
    ```

Here, the created Cloud Run service does not require any authentication as it is not supported by Terraform. Access is managed by directly updating bucket's IAM. The Cloud Run is deployed with all traffic allowed but you can also restrict to internal traffic only, but in this case, you'll have to make sure that a HTTPs endpoint is exposed or Terraform won't be able to pull the modules.

## Pushing modules

### 1. Download Petractl

Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/devoteamgcloud/petra/releases/latest) and download one of the following files, depending on you OS / CPU architecure:

=== "MacOS"

    - petra_x.x.x_darwin_amd64.tar.gz (Intel)
    - petra_x.x.x_darwin_arm64.tar.gz (Apple Silicon)

=== "Linux"

    - petra_0.4.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz (x86_64)
    - petra_0.4.1_linux_arm64.tar.gz (arm64)

### 2. Create a petra-config.yaml file for your module

```yaml title="petra-config.yaml"
namespace: production
name: my-module
provider: google
version: 1.0.3
```

!!! note "The file must be located at the root of your module"

### 3. Push the module

Make sure that you have the permission to write new files on the bucket `$BUCKET_NAME`. 

```bash
petractl push --bucket $BUCKET_NAME ./path/to/module
```

## Use your modules in Terraform

In order to use the modules, make sure that the user or Service Account that will be running the `terraform init` command has access to the petra server and read access permission on the bucket `$BUCKET_NAME` (or that the `SIGNED_URL` option is enabled).

Here is an example of Terraform code that use a petra hosted module:

```hcl title="main.tf"
module "mod1" {
    source = "petra.example.com/production/my-module/google"
    version = "1.0.3"
}
```

!!! warning "`petra.example.com` has to support HTTPS or Terraform's init command won't work"
